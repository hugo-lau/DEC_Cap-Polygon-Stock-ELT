# Data Visualisation on Apache Preset
Apache Preset connected to Clickhouse and Snowflake warehouse for Streaming and Batch-processing pipelines respectively.

# Clickhouse Streaming Data
In preset, three charts were created directly off the clickhouse data. One was a line chart showing the live stock price while another chart was a bar chart showing the calculated percentage change over every 10s window. Lastly, there was a table showing the corresponding price, volume stock and timestamp. The dashboard was set to refresh every 10s to 30s, to illustrate the charts updating as streaming data came in.
